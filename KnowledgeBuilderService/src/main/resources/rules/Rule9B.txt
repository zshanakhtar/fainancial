(2) Where a feature film is acquired by the film distributor in any previous year and in such previous year—
(a)   the film distributor sells all rights of exhibition of the film, the entire cost of acquisition of the film shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits and gains of such previous year; or
(b)   the film distributor,—
(i)   himself exhibits the film on a commercial basis in all or some of the areas; or
(ii)   sells the rights of exhibition of the film in respect of some of the areas; or
(iii)   himself exhibits the film on a commercial basis in certain areas and sells the rights of exhibition of the film in respect of all or some of the remaining areas,

(c)   himself exhibits the film on a commercial basis in certain areas and sells the rights of exhibition of the film in respect of all or some of the remaining areas,
and the film is not released for exhibition on a commercial basis at least ninety days before the end of such previous year, the cost of acquisition of the film in so far as it does not exceed the amount realised by the film distributor by exhibiting the film on a commercial basis or the amount for which the rights of exhibition have been sold or, as the case may be, the aggregate of the amounts realised by the film distributor by exhibiting the film and by the sale of the rights of exhibition, shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits and gains of such previous year; and the balance, if any, shall be carried forward to the next following previous year and allowed as a deduction in that year.
(4) Where during the previous year in which a feature film is acquired by the film distributor, he does not himself exhibit the film on a commercial basis or does not sell the rights of exhibition of the film, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of the cost of acquisition of the film in computing the profits and gains of such previous year; and the entire cost of acquisition shall be carried forward to the next following previous year and allowed as a deduction in that year.

(ii)   has sold the rights of exhibition of the feature film; or
(iii)   has himself exhibited the feature film on a commercial basis in some areas and has sold the rights of exhibition of the feature film in respect of all or some of the remaining areas,
