(a)   where the Assessing Officer has refused to admit evidence which ought to have been admitted ; or
(b)   where the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from producing the evidence which he was called upon to produce by the Assessing Officer ; or
(c)   where the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from producing before the Assessing Officer any evidence which is relevant to any ground of appeal ; or
