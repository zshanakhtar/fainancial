(2) Where the asset is a share of an Indian company listed on a recognised stock exchange on the specified date, the fair market value of the share shall be the observable price of such share on the stock exchange:
Provided that where the share is held as part of the shareholding which confers, directly or indirectly, any right of management or control in relation to the aforesaid company, the fair market value of the share shall be determined in accordance with the following formula, namely :—

(3) Where the asset is a share of an Indian company not listed on a recognised stock exchange on the specified date, the fair market value of the share shall be its fair market value on such date as determined by a merchant banker or an accountant in accordance with any internationally accepted valuation methodology for valuation of shares on arm's length basis as increased by the liability, if any, considered in such determination.
(4) Where the asset is an interest in a partnership firm or an association of persons, its fair market value shall be determined in the following manner, namely:—

(ii)   the portion of the value computed in clause (i) as is equal to the amount of its capital shall be allocated among its partners or members in the proportion in which capital has been contributed by them and the residue of the value shall be allocated among the partners or members in accordance with the agreement of partnership firm or association of persons for distribution of assets in the event of dissolution of the firm or association, or, in the absence of any such agreement, in the proportion in which the partners or members are entitled to share profits and the sum total of the amount so allocated to a partner or member shall be treated as the fair market value of the interest of that partner or member in the firm or the association of persons, as the case may be.
(5) The fair market value of the asset other than those referred to in sub-rules (2), (3) and (4) shall be the price it would fetch if sold in the open market on the specified date as determined by a merchant banker or an accountant as increased by the liability, if any, considered in such determination.
(6) The fair market value of all the assets of a foreign company or an entity shall be determined in the following manner, namely:—
(i)   where the transfer of share of, or interest in, the foreign company or entity is between the persons who are not connected persons, the fair market value of all the assets owned by the foreign company or the entity as on the specified date, for the purpose of such transfer, shall be determined in accordance with the following formula, namely:—
  Fair market value of all assets = A+B
  Where:
  A = Market capitalisation of the foreign company or entity computed on the basis of the full value of consideration for transfer of the share or interest;
  B = book value of the liabilities of the company or the entity as on the specified date as certified by a merchant banker or an accountant;

  B = book value of the liabilities of the company or the entity as on the specified date:
  Provided that where, as on the specified date, the share is listed on more than one stock exchange, the observable price in the aforesaid formula shall be in respect of the stock exchange which records the highest volume of trading in the share during the period considered for determining the price;
(b)   the share in the foreign company or entity is not listed on a stock exchange on the specified date, the value of all the assets owned by the foreign company or the entity shall be determined in accordance with the following formula, namely :—
  Fair market value of all the assets = A+B
  Where:
  A = fair market value of the foreign company or the entity as on the specified date as determined by a merchant banker or an accountant as per the internationally accepted valuation metho-dology;
  B = value of liabilities of the company or the entity if any, considered for the determination of fair market value in A.
(7) Where fair market value has been determined on the basis of any interim balance sheet referred to in the first proviso to clause (ix) of the Explanation, then the fair market value shall be appropriately modified after finalisation of the relevant financial statement in accordance with the applicable laws and all the provisions of this rule and rules 11UC and 114DB shall apply accordingly.
