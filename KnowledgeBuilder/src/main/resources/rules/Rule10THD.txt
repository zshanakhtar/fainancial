Provided that the return of income for the relevant assessment year is furnished by the assessee on or before the date of furnishing of Form 3CEFB:
52[Provided further that in respect of eligible specified domestic transactions, other than the transaction referred to in clause (iv) of rule 10THB, undertaken during the previous year relevant to the assessment year beginning on the 1st day of April, 2013 or beginning on the 1st day of April, 2014 or beginning on the 1st day of April, 2015, Form 3CEFB may be furnished by the assessee on or before the 31st day of March, 2016:]
53[Provided also that in respect of eligible specified domestic transactions, referred to in clause (iv) of rule 10THB, undertaken during the previous year relevant to the assessment year beginning on the 1st day of April, 2013 or beginning on the 1st day of April, 2014 or beginning on the 1st day of April, 2015, Form 3CEFB may be furnished by the assessee on or before the 31st day of December, 2015.]
(2) On receipt of Form 3CEFB, the Assessing Officer shall verify whether—
(i)   the assessee exercising the option is an eligible assessee; and
(ii)   the transaction in respect of which the option is exercised is an eligible specified domestic transaction,
before the option for safe harbour by the assessee is treated to be validly exercised.
(3) Where the Assessing Officer doubts the valid exercise of the option for the safe harbour by an assessee, he may require the assessee, by notice in writing, to furnish such information or documents or other evidence as he may consider necessary, and the assessee shall furnish the same within the time specified in such notice.
(4) Where—
(a)   the assessee does not furnish the information or documents or other evidence required by the Assessing Officer; or
(b)   the Assessing Officer finds that the assessee is not an eligible assessee; or
(c)   the Assessing Officer finds that the specified domestic transaction in respect of which the option referred to in sub-rule (1) has been exercised is not an eligible specified domestic transaction; or
(d)   the tariff is not in accordance with the circumstances specified in sub-rule (2) of rule 10THC,
the Assessing Officer shall, by order in writing, declare the option exercised by the assessee under sub-rule (1) to be invalid and cause a copy of the said order to be served on the assessee:
Provided that no order declaring the option exercised by the assessee to be invalid shall be passed without giving an opportunity of being heard to the assessee.
(5) If the assessee objects to the order of the Assessing Officer under sub-rule (4) declaring the option to be invalid, he may file his objections with the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner or the Principal Director or the Director, as the case may be, to whom the Assessing Officer is subordinate, within fifteen days of receipt of the order of the Assessing Officer.
(6) On receipt of the objection referred to in sub-rule (5), the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner or the Principal Director or the Director, as the case may be, shall after providing an opportunity of being heard to the assessee, pass appropriate orders in respect of the validity or otherwise of the option exercised by the assessee and cause a copy of the said order to be served on the assessee and the Assessing Officer.
(7) For the purposes of this rule,—
(i)   no order under sub-rule (4) shall be made by an Assessing Officer after expiry of a period of three months from the end of the month in which Form 3CEFB is received by him;
(ii)   the order under sub-rule (6) shall be passed by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner or Principal Director or Director, as the case may be, within a period of two months from the end of the month in which the objection filed by the assessee under sub-rule (5) is received by him.
(8) If the Assessing Officer or the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner or the Principal Director or the Director, as the case may be, does not pass an order within the time specified in sub-rule (7), then the option for safe harbour exercised by the assessee shall be treated as valid.
